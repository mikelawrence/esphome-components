### Configuration Variables
+ **model** (**Required**, string): The model of the Range Finder Sensor. Options are ```TFMINI_PLUS```, ```TFMINI_S``` or ```TF_LUNA```.
+ **uart_id** (*Optional*, string): Manually specify the ID of the [UART Bus](https://esphome.io/components/uart) if you use multiple UART buses.
+ **sample_rate** (*Optional*, integer): The frame rate at which the sensor will output sensor data in samples per sec. For the TFMINI_PLUS and TFMINI_S the range is 1-1000. For the TFLuna the range is 1-500. Note when low_power mode is set to true for the TFMINI_S and the TFLuna model the is significantly lower from 1-10. Default is 100. 
+ **config_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types#config-pin-schema)): This pin when connected will be set high to enable UART mode. (*TF_LUNA only*) 
+ **low_power** (*Optional*, boolean): Turns on low power mode. This also requires sample_rate to be 10 or less. (*TF_LUNA, TFMini-S only*) 

### Sensors
+ **distance** (*Optional*): Distance in cm. For the TFMINI_PLUS and TFMINI_S the range is 10-1200cm. For the TFLuna the range is 20-800cm. A distance of 10000cm means the sensor is not receiving enough signal, most likely open air. A distance of 0cm means the sensor is saturated and there is no measurement possible. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
+ **signal_strength** (*Optional*): Represents the signal strength with a range of 0-65535. The longer the measurement distance, the lower signal strength will be. The lower the reflectivity is, the lower the signal strength will be. When signal strength is less than 100 detection is unreliable and distance is set to 10000cm. When signal strength is 65535 detection is unreliable and distance is set to 0cm. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
+ **temperature** (*Optional*): Internal temperature in Â°C. It's not clear how useful this sensor because it certainly does not measure room temperature. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).

## ESPHome STUSB4500 External Component

The STUSB4500 is a USB power delivery controller that supports sink up to 100 W (20V, 5A). It has Non-Volatile Memory that can be programmed with your PDO profile so when you connect to a USB-C Power Source it will immediately negotiate your power delivery contract.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.sparkfun.com/media/catalog/product/cache/a793f13fd3d678cea13d28206895ba0c/1/5/15801-SparkFun_Power_Delivery_Board_-_USB-C__Qwiic_-04.jpg" width="30%"><br />
    STUSB4500 board from SparkFun Electronics
</p>

There are 3 PDOs that you can configure with PD1 fixed at 5V. You can vary PD1's current. If you have all three PDOs configured the STUSB4500 will try to negotiate a contract with the PDOs in the following order: PD3, PD2 and PD1. If you don't want PDO1 negotiated then set ```power_only_above_5v: true```.

The configuration below the STUSB4500 will try to negotiate 12V @ 3A then 9V @ 3A. If neither are available then it won't negotiate at all. 

It also creates a ```PD State``` and ```PD Status``` Text Sensor.

### Actions
When the GPIO is configured for software control ```gpio_cfg: SW_CTRL_GPIO ``` these actions control the state of the output. 

+ **stusb4500.turn_gpio_on** Will pull the GPIO low.
+ **stusb4500.turn_gpio_off** Will set the output to High-Z.

Example using automations...
```
on_value_range:
  - below: 5.0
    then:
      - stusb4500.turn_gpio_on: pd_controller
```
Example in lambdas...
```
- lambda: |-
  id(pd_controller).turn_gpio_on();
```

### NVM Configuration

> [!CAUTION]
> When configuring the STUSB4500 for the first time you should realize the default configuration will allow up to 20V on V<sub>BUS</sub>. Make sure your circuit can either support 20V or configure the NVM using a Power Source that will NOT produce 20V like USB 2.0 or a non-PD USB-C charger.

Using the STUSB4500 ESPHome component requires the following steps:

1. Set the configuration variables to match your requirements. The sample configuration above sets PDO3 to 12V @ 3A, PDO2 to 9V @3A and PDO1 is disabled because ```power_only_above_5v: true```. This means it will first try to negotiate 12V @ 3A. If unavailable then it will try 9V @ 3A. If is unavailable no PD will be negotiated. Either the ```pd_state``` or ```pd_status``` sensor will let you know if there is a problem.
2. Add ```flash_nvm: true``` to the configuration.
   You should see the following messages in your log.
     ```log
     [00:10:03][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
     [00:10:03][E][stusb4500:119]:   NVM has been flashed, power cycle the device to reload NVM
     ```
   If you forgot to add ```flash_nvm: true``` to the configuration you will see an error in the log.
     ```log
     [00:06:27][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
     [00:06:27][E][stusb4500:114]:   NVM does not match current settings, you must set flash_nvm: true
     [00:06:27][C][stusb4500:130]:   PDO3 negotiated 9.00V @ 3.00A, 27.00W
     ```
3. Power cycle your board. Make sure ```NVM matches settings``` is present in the log and that one of your PDOs was negotiated. Configuring the STUSB4500 can be a bit finicky, but keep at it.
   ```log
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:112]: STUSB4500:
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:116]:   NVM matches settings
   [00:00:19][C][stusb4500:130]:   PDO3 negotiated 12.00V @ 3.00A, 36.00W
   ```
4. The STUSB4500 component does check that the NVM is indeed different before flashing it but it is prudent to remove the ```flash_nvm: true``` after it is clear the STUSB4500 is working as configured.


## ESPHome C4001 External Component

> [!NOTE]
> This component is in the process of being added to ESPHome. ESPHome [PR#9327](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/9327).


The DFRobot C4001 (SEN0609 or SEN0610) is a millimeter-wave presence detector. The C4001 millimeter-wave presence sensor has the advantage of being able to detect both static and moving objects. It also has a relatively strong anti-interference ability, making it less susceptible to factors such as temperature changes, variations in ambient light, and environmental noise. Whether a person is sitting, sleeping, or in motion, the sensor can quickly detect their presence.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://dfimg.dfrobot.com/enshop/SEN0609/SEN0609_Main_01.jpg" width="50%"><br />
    C4001 (SEN0609) 25m mmWave Presence Sensor
</p>

There are two variants:

+ SEN0609 has a 100Â° horizontal and 40Â° vertical field of view, 16 meter presence detection range and 25 meter motion detection range.
+ SEN0610 has a 100Â° horizontal and 80Â° vertical field of view, 8 meter presence detection range and 12 meter motion detection range.

> [!NOTE]
> Some settings have different ranges depending on the variant used. This component treats both variants the same, so it is your responsibility to make sure your configuration sets these values appropriately.

The sensor can operate in one of two modes, ```Presence``` and ```Speed and Distance```. In ```Presence``` mode the sensor provides a singular occupancy output. The presence output once presence is detected will stay on for a period that can be configured. In ```Speed and Distance``` mode the occupancy binary sensor indicates if a target is being tracked or not. Each time the sensor indicates presence it also outputs target distance, target speed and target energy. In ```Speed and Distance``` mode all of these parameter update frequently. There are only two settings for this mode, micro_motion_enable switch and threshold_factor number.

The C4001 sensor maintains settings in flash. When powered on these settings are loaded from flash and made operational. To change the configuration of the sensor dial in the setting you need and hit the config_save button. This will tell the sensor to store the new settings in flash and make them operational. You only need to do this once.

More information on the C4001 (SEN0609) sensor is available [here](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2793.html). Information on the C4001 (SEN0610) sensor is available [here](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2795.html).

Example using automations...

```yaml
button:
  - platform: template
    name: Factory Reset
    on_press:
      - dfrobot_c4001.factory_reset: mmwave_sensor
    entity_category: CONFIG

```
Example in lambdas...

### Numbers
+ **installation_angle** (*Optional*): Allows you to change the installation angle in Â°. Makes it easy to use when installed in a corner. Default is 0Â° with a range of Â±45Â°. All Options from [Number](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-number).

## SEN5X External Component


> [!NOTE]
> A Pull Request to change the sen5x component in ESPHome is in progress. ESPHome [PR#9254](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/9254).


This external component adds SEN60, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66 and SEN68 support to the built-in sen5x component. This component extends [PR #8318](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/8318). Only the differences from sen5x component are listed below.

Temperature compensation is not working for the SEN6x models. Still waiting on the Sensirion Application Note.

### Configuration Variables
+ **model** (**Optional**, string): The model of the Sensirion SEN5X or SEN6X sensor. Options are ```SEN50```, ```SEN54```, ```SEN55```, ```SEN60```, ```SEN63C```, ```SEN65```, ```SEN66``` or ```SEN68```. Use this if the model cannot be read from the sensor. There were reports of a blank model string on a SEN66 sensor.
+ **auto_cleaning_interval** (**Optional**, string): The interval in seconds of the periodic fan-cleaning. Only the SEN50, SEN55 and SEN56 models support automatic fan cleaning.

### Sensors
+ **co2** (*Optional*): The Carbon Dioxide (COâ) level in ppm. Only the SEN63C and SEN66 models have a COâ sensor. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).
  - **auto_self_calibration** (*Optional*, boolean): Enables automatic self-calibration (ASC) for the COâ sensor. Default is ```true```.
  - **altitude_compensation** (*Optional*, int): Enable compensating deviations due to current altitude (in metres). Notice: setting altitude_compensation is ignored if ambient_pressure_compensation is set.
  - **ambient_pressure_compensation_source** (*Optional*, ID): Set an external pressure sensor ID used for ambient pressure compensation. The pressure sensor must report pressure in hPa. The correction is applied before updating the state of the COâ sensor.
+ **hcho** (*Optional*): The Formaldehyde (HCHO) level in ppb. Only the SEN68 model has a HCHO sensor. All Options from [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#config-sensor).


### Actions

#### sen5x.perform_forced_co2_calibration Action
This action manually calibrates the COâ sensor to the provided value in ppm. Let the COâ sensor operate normally for at least 3 minutes before performing a forced calibration.

```
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.perform_forced_calibration:
        # Global Monthly Mean COâ
        # https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/global.html
        value: 426
        id: my_sen66
```

#### sen5x.set_ambient_pressure_hpa Action
This action sets the current pressure (hPa or mbar). Check the datasheet for COâ pressure compensation. You can also just set the ID of your pressure sensor with ```ambient_pressure_compensation_source```. Only the SEN63C and SEN66 models have a COâ sensor. 

```
sensor:
  - platform: pressure_sensor
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: !lambda |-
            // convert pressure to hPa before sending to sen5x sensor
            id(my_sen66)->set_ambient_pressure_compensation(x / 100.0);"
```

#### sen5x.activate_heater Action
This action turns the humidity sensor's heater on for 1s at 200mW. This action only works for the SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66 and SEN68 models. Unlike the SHT4X there is no further configuration nor a way to setup automatic heating interval. I may need to add code to emulate the automatic nature built-in to the SHT4X for the heater.

```
on_value:
  then:
    - lambda: !lambda "id(my_sen66)->activate_heater();"
```
